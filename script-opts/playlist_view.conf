# thumbnail directory in which to create and look for thumbnails
# on Unix-like platforms: thumbs_dir=~/.cache/thumbnails/mpv-gallery

# all options below are platform-independent

# fine-grained controls for the geometry of the gallery
# options can be fixed values or dynamic using the following variables:
# ww, wh: mpv window width, mpv window height (always available)
# gx, gy: gallery horizontal position, gallery vertical position
# gw, gh: gallery width, gallery height
# sw, sh: minimum spacing width, minimum spacing height
# tw, th: thumbnail width, thumbnail height

# these strings are interpreted using the lua equivalent of "eval" so math functions and logical conditions can be used
# if an option references variables, they will be computed in the appropriate order 
#for example, if gallery_width == 5 * thumbnail_width, thumbnail_size will be computed before gallery_size
# in case of cyclical dependencies, the script will abort

# make the gallery centered
gallery_position={ (ww - gw) / 2, (wh - gh) / 2 }

# make the gallery's size 9/10 the size of the window
#gallery_size={ 9 * ww / 10, 9 * wh / 10 }
gallery_size={ 9 * ww / 10, 9 * wh / 10 }

# At least 15 pixels of spacing between each thumbnail
min_spacing={ 2, 2 }

# and two thumbnail size presets for Windows smaller/bigger than 1366 x 768
#thumbnail_size=(ww * wh <= 1366 * 768) and {192, 108} or {288, 162}
thumbnail_size=(ww * wh <= 1600 * 900) and {400, 224} or {337, 189}
#thumbnail_size=(ww * wh <= 1366 * 768) and {400, 224} or {400, 300}
