- **playlist-view.lua**: Provides an on-screen playlist viewer for easily navigating through the loaded playlist.
- **playlistmanager.lua**: Enhances playlist management with features like sorting, reordering, and advanced navigation.
- **seek-to.lua**: Allows for quick seeking to specific timestamps in the video using on-screen prompts.
